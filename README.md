🧠 How AI Mood Detection Works

The app activates the camera and captures a facial image.

The image is encoded in Base64 and sent securely to the Google Cloud Vision API.

The API returns emotion likelihoods (joy, sorrow, anger, etc.).

MindMate interprets this data and displays the user’s mood dynamically on the dashboard.
